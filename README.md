# About
Repository of tools I worked on when working as a NOC Engineer. 

Some projects are dedicated to the development of automation tools and resources tailored for Network Operations Center (NOCs). Goal was to streamline NOC operations, improve efficiency, and enhance network monitoring capabilities.

These projects do not provide any practical usefulness outside the scope of my work at eToro. This is solely an archive for the projects I participated in and contributions I made to the team.
